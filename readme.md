# Learning Deep Learning from Dr. Cohen 

This respository contains codes for Mike Cohen's course on Deep Learning in Udemy. 

I am personalizing some parts of these codes and put my own version on the Github, while updating and addeing more codes and explainations to some parts. 

I started watching this course in early 2022 and I try to finish it by the end of 2022. This is a perfect course with lots of useful codes and solid explainations by Dr. Cohen.
